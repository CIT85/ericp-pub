            <h3>Hirohiko Araki Quote about his Art</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Araki thus seems to have succeeded in creating a sense of contemporariness and reality that directly links to the world we live in by incorporating elements from philosophy, economy, and the natural sciences. “When you draw a tree, it ends up looking weird if you don’t thoroughly observe how the branches are attached. To draw is, in that sense, something like a chemical experiment. In many ways, I learn by drawing. My ideal is to portray the world of JoJo based on an idea or theory that unifies everything from the natural sciences, to philosophy and economy. Manga pertains to fantasy, to the fictional. But when it is drawn based on a unified idea or theory, the characters, in a strange way, begin to feel as though they truly exist there. That’s what’s really fun, and that’s what I always seek when I draw.”</p>
