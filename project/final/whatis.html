            <h2>What is Apex Legends?</h2>
            <p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It is set in the Titanfall universe but does not feature the series' trademark Titans. Instead, players select one of several "Legends," each with their own unique abilities, and compete in squads of three to be the last team standing on a constantly shrinking map.</p>
            <p>Matches in Apex Legends typically begin with teams of three players skydiving onto the map from a dropship. Once on the ground, players must quickly scavenge for weapons, armor, and other loot to prepare for combat. As the match progresses, a series of environmental hazards known as the "Ring" forces players into closer proximity, leading to intense firefights and strategic gameplay.</p>
            <p>Apex Legends is known for its fast-paced action, fluid movement mechanics, and emphasis on teamwork. With a <a href="diverse.html">diverse</a> roster of Legends to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, players must coordinate their abilities and tactics to outsmart their opponents and emerge victorious.</p>
