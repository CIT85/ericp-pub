#  Why I choose Apex Legends?
- This is one of the first choiced that I thought about when deciding what project idea I was going to do. It was either going to about Apex legends or JoJo Bizarre Adventure but I already did a similar project on JoJo so I wanted to do something different and write about Apex legends. I have over 3000+ hours on this game and I know a lot about the game. This is one of my favorite games of all time!
